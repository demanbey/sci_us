  long_description: "Though mathematics is not an experimental science, mathematicians often look for examples to test conjectures (which they then hope to prove). As the number of examples increases, so does (in a sense) their understanding of the distribution. The goal is to collect all amicable numbers up to a very large limit. This data will facilitate theoretical research in the field: 1, 2, 3 to name a few examples. It will also help to improve understanding of the properties of Divisor function.",

Modern radio SETI projects analyze the data digitally. More computing power enables searches to cover greater frequency ranges with more sensitivity. Radio SETI, therefore, has an insatiable appetite for computing power.",

Join the Bird Cams Lab to document Red-tailed Hawk behavior and vocalizations using clips from a 24/7 camera at a Red-Tailed Hawk nest on Cornell University's campus. The Bird Cams Lab is a new project from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, funded by the National Science Foundation. The project aims to connect cam viewers with researchers in an online space to co-create scientific investigations, involving viewers in every step of the scientific process: observing, questioning, collecting and analyzing data, and sharing results.",
  long_description: "Previous researchers that have documented Red-tailed vocalizations have been mostly limited to what they can hear on the ground or when briefly checking a nest. The 24/7 Red-tailed Hawk cam gives us the chance to document vocalizations right at the nest for the entire season without disturbing the birds! Join us for this first round of clips in which we will look at the first week of footage after the nestlings start to hatch. We also invite you to learn more about the Bird Cams Lab project and sign up to help us test new activities for co-created research investigations.",
  about: "It's long been known that many bird species interact and share space at bird feeders, but there are still many questions to answer about the factors that influence these interactions. In this iteration of Battling Birds, we will take a look at footage from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Sapsucker Woods FeederWatch Cam, and note the number of species, the number of individuals, and whether there are any displacements, one type of aggressive interaction. This will help us answer the main research question, How does the diversity of species and abundance of individuals affect behavioral interactions (specifically displacements) at a feeder?",
